# Homework Submission Guidelines

## Extension Requests

* To request an extension, **contact Dr. Johnson at least 48 hours before the homework deadline, except for emergencies**.
* **Late submissions without prior approval will incur point deductions** as outlined in the syllabus.

## Regrading

* If you receive comments like "**fix this and please resubmit or show me in lab**," address the mentioned issues for potential point recovery.
* **Follow the provided formatting instructions** to streamline the regrading process.
* Contact Dr. Johnson or Achyuth for **detailed grading breakdown or to discuss grading concerns**.
* **Regrading requests are accepted until the next homework due date** (approximately 2 weeks).

## General Formatting

* You can use any language or extensions/packages, but inform Dr. Johnson if using **less popular ones**.
* Submission must include a **compilable script**; submitting only a **PDF/doc/screenshot is not acceptable**.
* **Compress files into one `.zip` file** (other formats accepted, but avoid using RAR).
* **Personalize file names with your name or identifier** to avoid confusion.
* **Include all necessary input files in the submission**.
* Create a `**main**` file for easy compilation.
* **Restart the kernel and rerun the entire script before submission**.

## Types of Questions and Trial Run

### 1. Q&A / Math / Textbook Problems
* **No coding required**.
* Use **pen and paper, markdown, or command-line printing**.
* **Do not embed answers in comments or docstrings**.

### 2. "Do as Instructed" Problems
* Follow **specified instructions for handling input datasets**.

### 3. "Create a Function/Program" Problems
* **Write a function or program**.
* In the "**main**" file, **import and refer to the function**.
* Include **trial input values and results** (tables, graphs, `.dat` files) in the .zip.

## Structuring Code

* **Structurize code for efficiency and error identification**.
* Use one "**main**" file to **combine independent components**.
* Benefit from **easier debugging and partial credit attribution**.

## Graph Requirements

* **Label all axes clearly**; titles are optional.
* Ensure **readable text on labels without overlap**.
* Set **appropriate x and y-axis ranges**.
* Clearly depict the **general tendency and critical points in the graph**.
* Use **suitable dot size in scatter plots to avoid blending**.

## Commenting and Docstrings

* Prioritize **code understanding over a strict comment-to-code ratio**.
* **Points will not be deducted based on comments and docstrings**.
* Use **GPT or IDE add-ons for formatting/templating docstrings**.
* **Lab slides on commenting and docstrings will be provided after the session**.
